# Deployment Instructions

## GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Optimized build for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**

   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "main" branch
   - Set folder to "/ (root)" or "/dist" if you want to use the dist folder
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

3. **Your game will be available at:**
   `https://yourusername.github.io/NASA-s-farming-game/`

## Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you want to deploy the dist folder manually:

1. Copy the contents of the `dist` folder
2. Upload to any web hosting service
3. Make sure to serve `index.html` as the main file

## Performance Tips

- The service worker will cache assets for faster loading
- Critical assets are preloaded
- Videos and large assets are loaded on demand
- The game should load much faster after the first visit
