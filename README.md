# 🌱 NASA Farming Game

An interactive educational game about climate change challenges in agriculture, developed as part of NASA's educational initiatives.

## 🎮 About the Game

This game teaches players about real-world farming challenges caused by climate change, including:
- **Drought conditions** and water management
- **Flooding** and its impact on crops
- **Heat stress** on plants and adaptation strategies
- **Soil salinization** and sustainable farming practices
- **Precision agriculture** using satellite data (NDVI maps)
